# How's Your Day
This project was a homework due for the Trilogy & University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. This project was intended to hone my skills in
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Javascript
 * jQuery

The homework for this project instructed me to construct a basic battle game. 
 1. Click on a character to begin the game
 2. Once a character is picked, the user will play as the character until the end of the game.
 3. The user must strategically pick their battle with enemies of different levels of HP and attack points.
    * When player chooses an enemy to attack, the enemy will be moved to the "Defender" section of the game and an "Attack" button will be available.
    * When a the player attacks, each attack will increase player's attack base points (Example, the player's attack points begins at 10 and increases by 10 each time an attack is made).
    * The enemy's attack points remain the same after each attack.
    * A player or an enemy loses when their HP goes to or below 0.
    * When a player wins a battle, they will be prompted to choose available enemies until there are none left.
        * If there are none left, the player has won the game and prompted to restart to try out other characters to play as!
    * When a player loses a battle, they will be prompted to restart the game as well.
