# How's Your Day
This project was a homework due for the Trilogy & University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. This project was intended to hone my skills in
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Javascript

The homework for this project instructed me to construct a basic hangman game. The requirements were to use event listeners to obtain information on the player.
 1. Press any key to start
 2. Guess a letter from A-Z. This game can differentiate between letters and symbol thanks to ASCII codes.
 3. A count of wrong and right letters are kept and compared to the length of the string for scoring.
 4. When a player wins or loses a game, the game is restarted and a new random word is displayed.
